# first-repo

This is my first repository on GitHub. Here is a C program which prints only one command-line argument

## Installation
use GNU [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) tool to compile
```bash
make prog
```

### Usage

just run the following after compiling
```bash
$ bin/prog "Hello World!"
```
